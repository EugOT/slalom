Sparse Factor analysis models in python.

The original publications describing these models are:

L. Parts*, O. Stegle*, J. Winn, R. Durbin
Joint genetic analysis of gene expression data with inferred cellular phenotypes
PLoS Genetics 2011

M. Rattray, O. Stegle, K. Sharp, J. Winn
Inference algorithms and learning theory for Bayesian sparse factor analysis
Journal of Physics: Conference Series 2009


An alternative, more userfriendly version is also available in PEER, however with restricted support for inference methods:
